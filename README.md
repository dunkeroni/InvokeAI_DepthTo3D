# InvokeAI_DepthTo3D
Convert images into 3D using a depth map

Note: This repository is an experimental setup where the gaps created by depth parallax are provided as a mask for Stable Diffusion models to fill in. If you just want a node that makes a 3D image from a depth map and uses traditional interpolation to fill the gaps, this is not that. I made this repo public because someone on Discord wanted to try it out.
